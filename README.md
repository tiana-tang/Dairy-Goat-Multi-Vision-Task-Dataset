# Dairy-Goat-Multi-Vision-Task-Dataset

## Overview

Welcome to our Multi-Vision Task Dataset Repository for Dairy Goats! This repository contains a variety of annotated datasets for visual tasks created by our lab, including goat face recognition, instance segmentation, object detection, object tracking, pose estimation & behavior recognition, and semantic segmentation. Our goal is to advance the field of intelligent agriculture and provide data and references for future researchers.
